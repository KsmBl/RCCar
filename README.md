# RCCar  
Racio controlled car from scratch  

##MVP:  
controll ESC (electronic system controller) to change brushless motors speed  
use ELRS RX for long range inputs (ELRS is an open source radio protocol based on crossfire)  
change Servos direction to change the direction of the car  

##Addons:  
OSD for analog VTX (display values like speed and battery voltage on the analog video footage)  
GPS for speed calculation  
decrease hard vibrations with automatic steer controlls and an accelerometer  
analog VRX to USB to get the analog video footage as an Video input to the Laptop  
ELRS TX to USB to controll the car via the Laptop instead of an remote controll  

##nice to haves:  
Barometer for height calculation  
Kompas for better direction input and slightly better vibration absorbition  
3D visualisation of driven Track
